<img src="https://github.com/kashishshah881/random-forest-regressions/blob/master/images/str_return.png" width="1000">


In this project, we calculate the importance of features on stock market data.
I have used a random forest regression model to calculate which column in the stock market data has the most effect on next day Adj Close stock price. 


### Result:

The **5 Day Rolling Mean of Adjacent Close** has the most effect on the next day adjacent close stock price by **18%**

The Image at the start gives the returns based on **5 Day Rolling Mean of Adjacent Close**
